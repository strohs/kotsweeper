## About
This is an educational project designed to teach me some kotlin and JavaFX by creating a clone of Microsoft's "classic 
Minesweeper" (the version that shipped with Windows 98 through Windows XP.) Kotsweeper keeps most of the original's 
functionality, including the ability to right-click on a square in order to set a flag or question-mark. The game ends 
once you have placed all your mine marking flags at which point the board will be 
revealed and you can see which squares were marked correctly. To restart the game left-click the smiley face button. 
To set the board dimensions, use the option menu to set the numbers of rows/cols from between 5 and 25
